# Wheat-Disease-Prediction

Identifying the disease of wheat given an image of wheat plant.

The task is to classify wheat images into one of the predefined categories: `healthy or one of several disease types`.<br>
This classification will help in early detection and treatment of diseases, potentially saving crops and improving yield.

The data I am using is  from Kaggle's Wheat Plant Diseases dataset:
